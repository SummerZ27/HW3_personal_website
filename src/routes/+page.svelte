  <p>Welcome to my personal website! I'm a researcher and engineer working at the intersection of AI/ML and systems engineering. My work spans agentic AI workflows, production systems optimization, bioinformatics applications, and advanced machine learning research.</p>

  <p>I'm passionate about building end-to-end systems that solve real-world problems—from AI-native content creation pipelines to manufacturing scheduling systems, from gene information platforms to hierarchical forecasting models. This site showcases my projects, research, and provides a way to get in touch.</p>
